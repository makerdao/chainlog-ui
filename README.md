## Test locally with Docker
1. Make sure that older Docker images are removed, and containers are stopped, if you want to test new code:
```
docker rmi chainlog-ui
docker rmi chainlog-logger
docker rmi chainlog-checksum
```
2. Build the Docker images and start the 3 containers:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
3. Look at the logs:
```
docker logs -f chainlog-ui
docker logs -f chainlog-logger
docker logs -f chainlog-checksum
```
4. Stop the containers:
```
docker-compose down
```

**Note:** nginx.conf.template is being customized with the path `/checksum` and copied into the `chainlog-ui` container, for sending traffic to the container running the `checksum.py` script.
